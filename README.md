# libscheme

A simple Scheme interpreter with an easy-to-integrate API written by
Brent Benson in the early 1990s. A greatly modified version of this
interpreter [became the starting
point](https://www-old.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/icfp19-fddkmstz.pdf)
for [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), which currently uses Chez
Scheme as its implementation substrate.

A good explanation of the `libscheme` interpreter is in the paper
*libscheme: Scheme as a C Library* presented at the 1994 USENIX
Symposium on Very High Level Languages (VHLL):
